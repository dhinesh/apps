   short: Dont store TLS traffic 
   long:  |
      Dramatically reduce disk IOPs and storage by not storing SSL/TLS traffic
      on port 443. The app only prunes TLS traffic on 443 by inspecting the bytes
      at the start of the flow to ensure TLS handshake is present. 
      This app also prunes Google QUIC protocol on UDP 443. Used by YouTube.
